# Wireless Sensor Network Simulator

This simulation is able to distribute nodes on the surfaces of multiple shapes - representing different network topologies. It can even connect these nodes given some calculated distance. 
From there, the program has the ability to “color” each node based off its neighbors. Finally, the program can display the largest backbone of the graph, i.e. the structure that connects the largest amount of nodes on the network.

For a more detailed explanation of this program including performance statistics and a reduction to practice, please see Smith_WSN.pdf.
Please read it. It took me forever to write.
