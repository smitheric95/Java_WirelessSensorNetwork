EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
*	- INTRODUCTION
		- marketing effort
#	- PROGRAMMING ENVIRONMENT DESCRIPTION
		- was it overkill?
 		- interaction between system components needed for efficiency and display
		# Description of program for graphs/tables
#	- REFERENCES
		- SEVERAL PAPERS
		- major tools
*	- SUMMARY
		- major result
		- strongest features of your implementation
		- TABLE OF RESULTS (backbone selection procedures and displays table)
		- references to references

CORE
#	- REDUCTION TO PRACTICE
		- FIVE COMPONENTS ("appropriately integrated")
#			- DATA STRUCTURE DESIGN
				# copy from notebook
#			- ALGORITHM DESCRIPTIONS
				# copy from notebook
				# also see descriptions on page 8 of project handout
#			- ALGRORITHM ENGINEERING	
				# copy from notebook
#			- VERIFICATION WALKTHROUGH
				# complete coloring
#			- ALGORITHM EFFECTIVENESS
				- table of results (OVERVIEW of benchmarks and test graphs)
					- two to four that implement size and quality 
					- make this table about speed (parts 1,2,3 and total)
				- strength and weaknesses


RESULT SUMMARY & DISPLAY
*	- OUTPUT
		- standard output for each randomized benchmark 
		- output for each bipartite partition
			- note: points awarded on basis of use of illustrations (look pretty)
#	- TABLE 
		- for each graph (benchmark)
#		- SEQUENTIAL COLORING PLOT	
			- degree when deleted (in the smallest order) vs original degree
			- will require some code changes in the coloring algorithm
#		- COLOR CLASS SIZE DISTRIBUTION
			- percentages of each color ("distribution")
*		- SUMMARY TABLE
			- ID, N, R, M (numEdges), min degree, avg degree, real avg degree, max degree, 
			  max degree when deleted, number of colors, size
			  of largest color class, terminal clique size, num edges in largest bipartite subgraph,
			- if time permits:
				- for sphere, include number of faces
				- terminal clique size	
*		- BACKBONE SELECTION PROCEDURES AND DISPLAYS
			- for each benchmark:
				- screenshot
					- number of vertices
					- number of edges
				- for each two backbones:
					- screenshot (if necessary)
					- number of vertices
					- number of edges
					- domination percentage



line 200 has changed (alg description in notebook must reflect that) 
	no longer only going over 4 spots
line 143 has changed (alg description in notebook must reflect that)
	seeing if graph is complete
get rid of useless functions like sweepnodes
